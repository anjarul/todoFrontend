Development Documentation for Angular ToDoApp
==============================================

Introduction
------------
This document provides an overview and documentation for the development of the ToDoApp frontend using Angular. It includes information about the project structure, dependencies, and other important details.

Project Overview
----------------
The ToDoApp frontend is built using Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building web applications. It provides a user interface for managing tasks in the ToDo application. The frontend communicates with the backend API to perform CRUD operations on tasks. The application supports features like task creation, updating, and deletion.

Project Structure
-----------------
The project follows the standard structure of an Angular project. The main components of the project structure are as follows:

- `src/app`: Contains the TypeScript source code of the application.
- `src/assets`: Contains static assets like images or CSS files.
- `src/environments`: Contains environment-specific configuration files.
- `src/styles`: Contains global stylesheets for the application.

Key Dependencies
----------------
The project has the following key dependencies:

- Angular CLI: Version 15.2.8
- Node.js: Version 18.16.0
- Package Manager: npm 9.5.1

Development Setup
-----------------
To set up the development environment for the ToDoApp frontend, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your system. You can download them from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org).
2. Install Angular CLI globally by running the following command:
   ```
   npm install -g @angular/cli@15.2.8
   ```
3. Clone the ToDoApp frontend repository to your local machine.
4. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
5. Install project dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
6. Start the development server using the following command:
   ```
   ng serve
   ```
   This will compile the application and start a local development server accessible at `http://localhost:4200`.

Configuration
-------------
The project includes environment-specific configuration files in the `src/environments` directory. The main configuration file, `environment.ts`, is used for development purposes. Update the necessary configuration settings in this file, such as the API endpoint URL, to match your backend API.

Building for Production
-----------------------
To build the ToDoApp frontend for production, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
2. Run the following command to build the application:
   ```
   ng build --prod
   ```
   This will generate a production-ready build of the application in the `dist` directory.

Deployment
----------
To deploy the ToDoApp frontend, follow these steps:

1. After building the application, you can deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to a web server or a hosting platform of your choice.
2. Ensure that the backend API URL is correctly configured in the environment-specific configuration file for the production environment (`environment.prod.ts`).


Conclusion
----------
This documentation provides an overview of the ToDoApp frontend developed using Angular. It covers the project structure, dependencies, development setup, configuration, building for production, deployment, and testing. You can refer to this documentation for understanding the project and its development aspects.
